/*
Write a class RecentCounter to start recent requests.
It has only one method: ping(int t), where t represents some time in milliseconds.
Return the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.
Any ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will start, including the current ping.
It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than before.
